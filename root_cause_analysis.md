# Root Cause Analysis of Global Layoffs (2020–2023)

Based on the exploratory data analysis, the global wave of layoffs can be attributed to several key factors:

### 1. Post-Pandemic Overhiring

During 2020 and 2021, many companies rapidly expanded their workforce due to increased digital demand and remote work adoption. When market conditions normalized in 2022 and 2023, companies were left with excess employees.

This resulted in workforce corrections through large-scale layoffs.

### 2. Economic Slowdown and Inflation

High inflation and rising interest rates reduced consumer spending and limited business investments. Organizations shifted their focus from growth to cost efficiency.

This caused companies to cut operational costs, including employee headcount.

### 3. Tech Industry Market Contraction

Technology companies experienced the highest number of layoffs, especially in the United States. Many tech firms relied heavily on advertising and subscription-based revenue, which declined during economic uncertainty.

Major companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft contributed significantly to total layoffs.

### 4. Startup Funding Reduction

Startups at Series C, Series D, and Post-IPO stages were affected by reduced venture capital funding and increasing operating costs.

Without continuous funding, many startups were forced to downsize their workforce to survive.

### 5. Business Restructuring and Automation

Several companies underwent restructuring, mergers, and operational optimization. Automation and process efficiency initiatives reduced the need for large workforces.

As a result, certain job roles were permanently eliminated.

### 6. Industry-Specific Demand Decline

Consumer, Retail, and Transportation sectors experienced a decline in demand due to changes in customer behavior and supply chain disruptions.

This led to higher layoffs in consumer-focused industries.

## Summary

The global layoffs from 2020 to 2023 were driven by a combination of post-pandemic overhiring, economic instability, reduced startup funding, and strategic business restructuring. The technology and consumer sectors were the most affected
